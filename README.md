# Filmbucket-version-2

Project requirements are below: 


You are to add an additional API within your project, that adds brand new functionality within your website
Create another word document, that resembles the API Research paper we did in Project 1, for this API you've added. 
You can add this document to the previously created paper in Project 1.
Update the project to use only Express.JS for all navigation within your project. Create a route for each page. You will need to set up server side coding, using Node.JS and Express.
Within each route, apply a CSS styling somewhere on the page.
Create a form within your webpage, using appropriate Bootstrap elements. The form will be used to register a user. The user should be to sign up with the following information: 
First Name (text field)
Last Name (text field)
Age (slider)
Occupation (drop down list)
Date of Birth (date picker)
Email (text field)
Password (secured text field)
Profile Picture (image)
Once registered, save all information using Express. Add a profile page (if not already) that displays all the information entered using Express, as well as the profile image uploaded. 
Allow the user to change or update their profile picture using Express. 
Using Express, create a login page that will allow a user to login if they use the correct email and password.
